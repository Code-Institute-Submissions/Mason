          <h3 class="jumbotron-heading">Where to Begin?</h3>
          <p class="lead text-muted">It's very scary in the beginning for my mom, as she didn't know whether she should pursue the Baby-Led Weaning method 
          or go the old fashioned route with Purees. She read and read and read so many blogs, articles, and books, and in the end, realized that it didn't matter.  It's what's best for her and me.  
          You see, I didn't have any teeth until almost 11 months old, so my mom was terrified of the possibility of me choking.  Although I did give her a few scares with some gagging in the beginning,
          she learned to relax (a little bit), and to just trust that whichever method she chose to feed me that day, I will be ok.  Here are some foods that I quite enjoyed (and still do), as well as some 
          videos.</p>

    <h5 style="text-align:center" class="mt-0">Pinwheels</h5>
    <p style="text-align:center">Pinwheels are delicious and super easy to make. My mom cheats and buys the pre-made puff pastry from the store and just rolls it out.  There are so many variations tnat
        can be made, so it's just a matter of finding what ingredients you like best inside a pinwheel.  Mine is pesto and mozarella cheese!  There's loads of recipes on pinterest if you want some 
        inspiration.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Green veggies like brocolli are super healthy and yummy. I can't get enough of brocolli since I love being able to easily grab the stems and feed myself.</p>

    <h5 style="text-align:center" class="mt-0">Fritters</h5>
    <p style="text-align:center">Fritters are also a super easy and yummy food for new eaters and experienced eaters like me.  My mom tries to hide veggies inside these fritters by blending
        them first. Whether or not the veggies are blended in, it's still quite tasty!</p>

    <h5 style="text-align:center" class="mt-0">Pouches</h5>
    <p style="text-align:center">Pouches are super easy and convenient for when we are out and about, or when mom just doesn't feel like cooking. There's so many flavours and 
    they are great when trying get a variety of foods in the diet, as they are all blended together.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Jars are super easy and convenient for when we are out and about as well, or when mom just doesn't feel like cooking. It's also super fun to try 
    and feed myself. My mom enjoys cleaning me up afterwards!</p>
