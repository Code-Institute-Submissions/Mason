Mason Milestone Project

Purpose:
Welcome to my website.  I wanted to maximize my learning by doing this project based on something of 
interest to me.  Instead of creating a webpage for a fictional rockband, I wanted to incorporate what 
I have learned so far with a topic that means the world to me, my son.  I feel that by turning this 
project into something that I would want to see myself, I would be able to incorporate what a viewer is 
looking for as well as make the website how I want it to be.

Planning & Implementation:
At first, this project was very daunting, as I had no idea where to begin.  I looked at different websites 
that I generally visit, as well various templates for inspiration and to determine my website's layout.  
Many alterations were made to the initial idea I had of the website in my head.  I did a lot of googling, and 
had to go back to many of the lessons that was covered in the course to make sure I'm doing things correctly.
I had a lot of difficulty with Bootstrap in the beginning, but in the end with a lot of persistence, it worked 
out. My biggest problem was making sure I had enough closing div elements in the html, since that significantly 
affected how my code turned out (or didn't for that matter). Each HTML page of the site was run through the W3C markup validation Service and the CSS was run through the W3C css validation Service.

The main purpose of my webpage is to help new mothers have some kind of guide for feeding their child. The 
baby food industry is a very huge industry, and it may be a little difficult for a first time mom to navigate 
through all the information that's out there.  My website is just a very easy breakdown of what works for my
son, as well as some links to videos that may be helpful for the mother.  

There are four pages for the user to visit on my webpage.  The home page is just an introduction in the eyes of
my son, Mason.  There are also photos presented in a carousel of him enjoying his food.  Both the feed me and feeding
essentials page include a list of items that I found useful for feeding.  There are also links to You Tube videos as 
well on those two pages.  The contact page is also provided in case a user wanted to contact me regarding any of the 
information that was provided on my webpage.  The footer is just blank, as I thought it would look cleaner that way. 
Instead, all of the social media links are on the contact page.  I didn't think a contact form was necessary for this
webpage, so instead, if the user wanted to contact me, they can click on the email me icon to send me an email.
